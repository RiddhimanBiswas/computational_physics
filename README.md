These are FORTRAN codes written for the assignments in the course PH3264 Computational Physics offered in IISER Pune.
Please refer to the website: https://apratimchatterji.wixsite.com/apratim/computational-physics-nptel-videos
The website contains links to the assignments which have been solved.

The assignments cover the following topics:
1. Assignment 1 : Introduction to FORTRAN - Random Number Generation and Random Walks.
2. Assignment 2 : Trazepoid and Monte Carlo Integration, Random Number Generation (Gaussian, Exponential).
3. Assignment 3 : Ising model - Ferromagnetic Transitions.
4. Assignment 4 : Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations - Euler, RK4, Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi methods. Dirichlet and Neumann Boundary conditions.
5. Assignment 5 : Turing Patterns.
6. Assignment 6 : Molecular Dynamics.

Each folder is structured as follows:
- .f90 files containing the codes for the questions. They are either named after questions or named appropriately.
- python_assignment$number$ : These folders contain the .py files for analysing the raw data and producing required images to be shown during viva.
- images_assignment$number$ : These folders contain the images to be shown with the exception of assignment 3, whose final images could be found in final_images folder.

Peer groups encouraged to do extra analysis other than mentioned in the question to understand better. These are included along with the answers to the required questions.

Important Notes:
- Assignment 5 here is assignment 7 of the website. Assignment 5 of the website was skipped in class due to time constraints.
- Assignment 6 just has the code. Images haven't been saved, but one could use the .py codes
